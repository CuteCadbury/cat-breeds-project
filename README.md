# Cat-Breeds-Project


The name of my project is ABC, which is an abbreviation for About Breeds Cat.
ABC uses public api and uses three main front-end coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 



## Description


I wanted to build an app with cat breed lists so users could choose a specific breed. When the breed is selected, a card with an image and information about that specific breed appears on the web page. Users can choose more cards of breeds and display them on the website to view and pick their favorite by adding and deleting.
To be more specific, when users select a cat breed from the dropdown. The breed chosen appears as a card on the web page, including a beautiful picture, description, temperament, lifespan and origin.
